# Title: 
Password Generator

# Description: 
    This repository is for creating a password generator. This is for the 3rd homework assignment in my web development class.

# Installation: 
    If all files are kept in a single folder a web browser should be able to run the project and you have an internet connection.

# Usage: 
    The usage of this is just for me to practice HTML, CSS, and more specifically Bootstrap. It could be used as a template for a portflio site, but I wouldn't recommend.

# Credits: 
    I created this code based on the homework prompt created by Triology Education Services. Certain pieces of code I used online resources for help. I have included citations in the form of comments throughout the html and javascript.

# Contributing: 
    I was the only one to work on this project, but of course I had help from my instructor, TA's, and classmates.

# Challenges: 
    I struggled early on with the sticky footer due to not adding the bootstrap scripts for the javascript code. I also struggled heavily with the navBar. At first I used a navBar from Bootstrap, which worked great. I then decided to try and make a navbar look exactly like the navbar in the homework pictures. Even after being told to use the navBar from bootstrap I still for some reason faught and faught to get it to work. This project has started to teach me to leave things alone if they work and they meet the homework requirements.
